# Coding Quiz

## Description

A mini quiz game designed to help someone work on their coding skills. The user pushes a start button to begin answering a series of questions. When they answer correctly it moves to the next question, if they answer incorrectly if subtracts 10 points and then moves on to the next question. At the end of the questions, then the player has the opportunity to store their initials with their score. They can then run through the game again to try and improve their score.

## Issues

- Still a problem if the user hits multiple buttons. I didn't know how to fix that.

- Another enhancement would be to have the high scores listed from highest to lowest.

- The size of the high score box doesn't change with the size of the high score list. Would be good to fix that aesthetically. But the game is functional.
